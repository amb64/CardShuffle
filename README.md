# CardShuffle

Creating pack and card classes to shuffle and deal cards.

In addition to the Card, Pack, and Program classes. There is a Menu class which handles all of the user input and the command-line user interface. (User output). 
There is also a Testing class which will run some basic testing commands (it performs all three shuffles and then deals 1 card, then deals the other 51 cards.)

The program is also fully-functional without the Testing class. If you navigate to the Program.cs file and hash the indicated lines (Lines 14 and 18), you will be able to use the program freely, picking which shuffle you want to perform and how many cards you want to draw.

I have added error handling and comments to my code. If anything doesn't run as expected, doesn't make sense, or seems inefficient, please let me know!
